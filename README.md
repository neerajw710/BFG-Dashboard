The preview of the dashboard (along with the tabs) is available [here.](https://wcykpywbhadxw3z4fbulgw-on.drv.tw/www.bfg_dashboard.nj/BGF_Dashboard.htm) 

The interactive dashboard is for real-time monitoring of the sales of products based on the criteria, such as Year, Category (Groceries, Clothes, etc.), Sales By Manager, and Location. It also monitors the trends in total sales and the forecast which can be used with the intuition of subject matter experts for data-driven decision making.
